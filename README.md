# ThreadBase

Welcome to ThreadBase, an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between daily communication and knowledge bases. 

Our vision is to reduce redundant communication and foster the creation of scalable knowledge, all while enhancing productivity without disrupting your workflow.

## What is ThreadBase?

ThreadBase addresses a universal challenge faced by teams: the difficulty of managing and organizing the valuable knowledge and insights that naturally arise in daily discussions. 

ThreadBase makes it effortless to save Slack threads, complete with titles and descriptions, and render them searchable. This ensures that you can access critical information whenever you need it.

## Features

- **Save Slack Threads:** Save Slack threads with ease, assigning them a title and description for future reference. These notes are fully searchable, allowing for quick retrieval of information. Share these saved threads with specific teams to enhance visibility and collaboration across your organization.

- **Confluence Integration:** Create a Confluence page directly from Slack, making it easier to build and expand your knowledge base while keeping documentation accessible.
